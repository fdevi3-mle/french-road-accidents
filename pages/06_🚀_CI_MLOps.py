 I decided to set up an
automatic Machine Learning system . The idea was to create a CI Pipeline
wherein the machine learning model would run and deploy the model as an
artifact of the pipeline for later use. This is how one would do even a simple ML
project in a production environment. CI/CD allows one to focus on the task of just
creating code and not worrying about running the model locally. This would
significantly free up my hardware and computational limitations .
So with this in mind and the desire to run longer training models I built a CI/CD
Pipeline which allows me to code and not worry about the local training of the
model and thus optimizing its parameters (see Figure 8)

ZenML was chosen as an MLOps orchestrator as it provided both a local and
cloud orchestration. The ZenML pipeline consists of steps involved in setting up a
an automatic Machine Learning Flow for the entire process of loading the data to
training the ML Model (see run-zenml.py).This pipeline was quite a feat and would allow me to finally focus on
creating models and tuning them rather than running the models.
I hit another roadblock in the space provided by DS and even after a request , no
reply was given. I am including this in the report as it is important to understand
how the DS is extremely poor and it's nothing short of a waste of time.
I would have loved to run a longer training for either the classifier or the time
series model but we are sticking with the results we achieved.
