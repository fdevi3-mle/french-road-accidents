### Methods

@st.cache_data
def data_loader(filepath=INPUT_PARQUET, sample_size=0.15): # size is low due to memory issues
    if filepath is None:
        filepath = INPUT_PARQUET
    df = pd.read_parquet(filepath)
    valid_columns = RoadAccidentEnum.to_dict()
    valid_columns = valid_columns.keys()
    df = df[[col for col in df.columns if col in valid_columns]]

    ## BLOCKER FOR SAMPLE SIZE
    if sample_size >0.25:
        sample_size = 0.25 ## just a block as streamlit cant handle large data
    logger.info(f" Creating a Random Sample of {sample_size * 100}% of data")
    df = df.sample(frac=sample_size, random_state=42)
    return df

Road Accidents are the leading cause of death worldwide for children and young adults till aged 30, causing over 1 million deaths annually [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/road-traffic-injuries).
This heavy cost not only incurs a toll on the future of the country but costs an estimated 3% loss of GDP to most countries
The objective of this project was to create a prediction model for accident severity and map out danger zones across France based on traffic accidents data.

### Project Goals
+ Analyze accident data
+ Predict the severity of the Traffic Accidents
+ Forecast accidents in France
+ Visualize the Danger Zones

The analysis was done from the years 2019-2023 and the area was limited to mainland France and its nearby island. We can visualize the accidents
below [^1]. 

[^1]: We have selected a tiny slice of the data as streamlit cant handle large files for viewing.

As we can see from the map above the French region accidents are cluttered around certain metropolitan areas (eg Paris).If we need to analyze how these
areas influence the likelihood of an accident we need to introduce some sort of clustering

The goal of the project asked for the creation of Danger Zones indicating regions
of France which are more risky in terms of traffic flow and its fatalities.
The Risk Score was born out of the idea to score each zone according to its risks
based on the number of accidents, the type of accidents and other factors
contributing to its score where 1 is lower risk and 4 being the highest risk. The Risk
Score can be simply calculated as the weighted average of factors influencing the
likelihood of having a fatality or injury given certain data variables

```
Risk Score = Î±Ã—[Primary Factors] + Î²Ã—[Secondary Factors]
```

where the weights can be set with Î± being a stronger weight , see code for
understanding the score. The score then can be used as a visualization tool to see
which zones of France are more riskier or dangerous in terms of traffic flow(see Figure 10)
One thing we notice that Paris has a lower risk score even though it has a large number of accidents. The two main reasons is the ```H3_RESOLUTION```
